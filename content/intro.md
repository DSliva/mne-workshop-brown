# Books with Jupyter and Jekyll

## Installation

Here's a brief rundown of how to create your own Jupyter Book using this site. For a more
complete guide, see [the Jupyter Book guide](guide/01_overview).

* Fork the Jupyter Book template repo
* Replace the demo notebooks in `content/` with your own notebooks and markdown files.
* Create a Table of Contents yaml file by editing `_data/toc.yaml`.
* Generate the Jekyll markdown for your notebooks by running `scripts/generate_book.py`
* Push your changes to GitHub (or wherever you host your site)!
